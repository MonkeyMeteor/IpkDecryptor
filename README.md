[](https://github.com/Poyoanon/IpkDecryptor)

This tool that decrypts Lost Ark .ipk files into .png and .bk2 files.

# Usage

## Drag and Drop

> - Place `IpkDecryptor.exe` in an empty folder, preferably.
> - For image files, **Drag and drop** the `ExtRes` folder `(usually found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lost Ark\EFGame\ReleasePC\Packages\ExtRes)` onto `IpkDecryptor.exe`.
> - For video files, **drag and drop** the `Movies` folder `(usually found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lost Ark\EFGame\Movies` onto `IpkDecryptor.exe`.
> - The PNGs will be placed in the `Output` folder in the same location as `IpkDecryptor.exe`.

## Command Line

> **Example:** `IpkDecryptor.Exe` [ source_folder ]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Currently, the movie files convert to a .bk2 format. You can view .bk2 files through [RAD Game Tools](https://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm), and also convert them to .mp4 files accordingly. Unless you know of a way to convert them with FFMpeg or whatever, to which, please submit an issue if you know how.
